        <h1>PLOT OF THE LAST OF US</h1>
           
        <p>After the events of the first game, <span>Joel Miller (Troy Baker)</span> confesses to his brother <span>Tommy (Jeffrey Pierce)</span> his responsibility in preventing the Fireflies attempting to find a cure for the Cordyceps fungus pandemic by saving <span>Ellie (Ashley Johnson)</span>. Four years later, <span>Joel</span> and <span>Ellie</span> have built a life in Jackson, Wyoming, though their relationship has become strained. While on patrol, <span>Joel</span> and <span>Tommy</span> rescue a stranger,  <span>Abby Anderson (Laura Bailey)</span>, from an Infected horde. They return to an outpost run by <span>Abby's</span> group, former Fireflies who are now part of the Washington Liberation Front (WLF), a militia group based in Seattle, Washington. They attack <span>Joel</span>and <span>Tommy</span>; Abby seeks revenge against Joel for murdering her father, the Firefly surgeon (Derek Phillips) who was to perform the operation on Ellie that would have killed her. 
            <br>
            Meanwhile,<span>Ellie</span>  and her girlfriend <span>Dina (Shannon Woodward)</span> leave ,<span>Jackson</span> in search of the brothers. <span>Ellie</span> enters the WLF camp to witness <span>Abby</span> beat <span>Joel</span> to death, and swears revenge. 

            ,<span>Tommy</span> sets out for Seattle to hunt <span>Abby</span>, and <span>ellie</span> and follow him. After escaping a WLF ambush, <span>Ellie</span> reveals her immunity to <span>Dina</span>, who in turn reveals she is pregnant. The next day, <span>Ellie</span> pursues <span>Tommy</span> alone and encounters Jesse (Stephen Chang), Dina's ex-boyfriend, who followed them to Seattle. While searching for Abby's friend, Nora Harris (Chelsea Tavares), Ellie encounters the Seraphites, a cult locked in a battle with the WLF over control of Seattle. Ellie tracks down Nora and tortures her for information on Abby's location, which traumatizes Ellie. The following day, she kills two more members of Abby's group, the pregnant Mel (Ashly Burch) and her boyfriend Owen Moore (Patrick Fugit). A flashback reveals that, years earlier, Ellie traveled to the Firefly hospital in Salt Lake City and learned the truth. Devastated, she cut ties with Joel. In the present, Ellie's group is ambushed by Abby, who kills Jesse and holds Tommy hostage. 
            
            Three days earlier, ,<span>Abby</span> learns that <span>Owen</span>, her ex-boyfriend, has gone missing while investigating Seraphite activity.<br><br><span>Abby</span> searches for <span>Owen</span>, and is captured by the Seraphites. She is rescued by Yara (Victoria Grace) and Lev (Ian Alexander), Seraphite siblings who have been branded apostates after Lev defied Seraphite traditions. Though Yara suffers a broken arm, Abby leaves them to find Owen who, disillusioned with the war, plans to sail to Santa Barbara, California, where the Fireflies may be regrouping. Abby returns to rescue Yara and Lev, and travels across Seattle with Lev to retrieve medical supplies from the WLF hospital so Mel can amputate Yara's arm. After the surgery, Lev runs away to convince his devout mother to leave the Seraphite cult, forcing Abby and Yara to pursue him. They find him in the Seraphite settlement, where Lev has accidentally killed his mother in self-defense. The trio flee as the WLF begins an assault on the Seraphites. Abby betrays the WLF to save Lev, and Yara sacrifices herself to allow Abby and Lev to escape. The pair return to find Owen and Mel dead and a map left by Ellie leading to her hideout. Abby shoots Tommy, impairing him, and brawls with Ellie and Dina, overpowering them.
            <br> At Lev's insistence, Abby spares them and tells them to leave Seattle. 
            
            Several months later, <span>Ellie</span> and <span>Dina</span> are living on a farm, raising and <span>Jesse's</span> son, though Ellie suffers from post-traumatic stress. When Tommy arrives with information on Abby's whereabouts, Ellie leaves to find her, despite Dina's pleas to stay. Abby and Lev arrive in Santa Barbara searching for the Fireflies, who they find are regrouping at Catalina Island, California, but are captured, tortured, and left to die by the slave-keeping Rattlers. Ellie arrives at Santa Barbara and rescues the pair. Threatening to kill Lev, Ellie forces Abby to fight her, during which Abby bites off two of Ellie's fingers. Ellie overpowers her but has a change of heart and lets her live. Abby and Lev sail to the Fireflies. Ellie returns to the farmhouse and finds it empty. She tries to play Joel's guitar with her damaged hand, recalls her last conversation with Joel in which she expressed her willingness to try and forgive him, and leaves.
