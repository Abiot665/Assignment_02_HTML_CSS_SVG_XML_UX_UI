        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Last of Us Part 2 has a lot to say about us as people after we connected ourselves to these characters in the first entry. The journey is one that is not for squeamish, but it was one that deserved to be told. As the player, we must once again witness the reality of this harsh world and those who are brought up in it...The Last of Us Part 2 is a masterclass in environmental design, and that can not be overlooked. The messiness of the second act doesn’t overshadow how significant this adventure is.</p>
